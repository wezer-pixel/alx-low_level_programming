Function pointers are variables that store memory
addresses of functions in programming languages
that support pointers. A function pointer points
to the code of a specific function in memory,
allowing you to call that function indirectly
through the pointer variable. Function pointers
can be useful for creating more flexible and dynamic
programs, as they allow you to pass functions as
arguments to other functions, store functions in data
structures, and create callback functions that can be
executed at a later time. In C and C++, function pointers
are commonly used to implement polymorphism and to create
dynamic libraries that can be loaded at runtime.
