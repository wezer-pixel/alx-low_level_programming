File I/O in C refers to the way in which C programs read data from and write data to files on a computer's storage system.
C provides a set of standard library functions that allow programmers to open, close, read from, and write to files.

The standard functions for file I/O in C are fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite(), fprintf(), and fscanf().
These functions allow programmers to open files, read data from them, write data to them, and close them when finished.

When a file is opened in C, it is associated with a file pointer that points to the beginning of the file.
This pointer can be moved forward or backward through the file using functions such as fseek() and ftell().
The file pointer is important for keeping track of where data has been read from or written to in the file.

C file I/O is essential for many programming tasks, including reading and writing configuration files,
logging program activity, and storing data for later retrieval.
