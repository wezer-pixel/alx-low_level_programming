A variadic function is a function that can accept a
varying number of arguments. In other words,
it is a function that is designed to handle
an indefinite number of parameters.

The most common example of a variadic function is
printf() in C programming language, which accepts
a variable number of arguments depending on the
format string.

In modern programming languages such as Python and
JavaScript, variadic functions are commonly implemented
using the spread syntax, which allows a function to be
called with an arbitrary number of arguments.

Variadic functions are useful in situations where the
number of arguments that a function may need to handle
is not known beforehand, or when a function needs to
be able to handle different types of inputs.
